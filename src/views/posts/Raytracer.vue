          description:"This is a implementation of the Monte Carlo ray tracer. It supports a simple scene with cubes and spheres that has different surface properties. Light is simulated by implementing importance rays that are sent from a viewpoint through an image plane containing pixels. When surface intersections occur, a fixed number of new rays gets distributed in different directions of a hemi-sphere with a probability density function. We terminate rays with a Russian Roulette algorithm. We also managed to parellalize the ray tracing process on the CPU with performance scaling. This gave us the render seen above with 256 samples.",
